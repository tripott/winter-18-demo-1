## UGA WINS THE SEC

UGA is the 2017 SEC Championship and they won the SEC east. South Carolina did _not_ win the SEC east. AND... UGA beat SCAR in football. My son goes to USC. But he's still kinda a UGA fan. He's transitioning. SCAR is our family B team. We root for them when they play Florida. Go Dawgs, sic em.  Woof, Woof, Woof.
